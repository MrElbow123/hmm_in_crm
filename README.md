# A hidden Markov model in CRM
  
  This code introduces the construction and estimation process of a hidden Markov model. 
  Our model is based on the scenario of customer relationship management. 
  Parameters are estimated using Bayesian estimation utilizing the forward-backward recursion within a hybrid Metropolis  within Gibbs sampler.  
  The initial code structure is based on the blog of Dr. Emmeke Aarts (https://github.com/emmekeaarts/mHMMbayes#mhmmbayes). 
  We modified the iteration method and parameter settings based on our scenario.
